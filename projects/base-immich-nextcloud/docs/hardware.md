# Recommended Hardware for Self-Hosting

Choosing the right hardware is essential for smoothly and efficiently running your self-hosted applications. Below are easy-to-understand recommendations to help you select hardware that meets your current needs and provides room for future expansion.

## CPU (Processor) and RAM (Memory)

- **CPU (Processor):** A low-power processor with 4 to 8 cores is typically sufficient for most home setups. More cores generally mean better multitasking and smoother performance when running multiple applications.
- **RAM (Memory):**
  - **Minimum Recommended:** **8GB** (Enough to handle basic self-hosted applications and everyday usage).
  - **Ideal for Future-Proofing:** **16GB** or more, especially if you anticipate adding additional features or applications such as collaborative tools, personal blogs, or other resource-intensive applications.

## Architecture (Type of CPU)

There are two main types of CPUs to consider:

- **AMD64 (also known as x86-64 or Intel/AMD processors):** Recommended for most users due to broad compatibility with common software and ease of setup.
- **ARM64 (for example, Raspberry Pi 5):** Ideal for users looking for energy-efficient, lightweight setups. Keep in mind that some software may not be compatible with ARM architecture, so ensure the applications you intend to use support this type of CPU.

## Storage Capacity

Your storage needs will depend greatly on how you plan to use your setup:

- **Recommended Minimum:** **2TB** of storage, which is usually adequate for storing family documents, photos, videos, and other personal data.
- **Future-Proofing Advice:** Consider choosing hardware that supports expandable storage, such as additional NVMe or SATA slots. This will allow you to easily increase storage capacity as your needs grow over the next several years.

When selecting hardware, think carefully about your current requirements and how they might evolve. Investing in slightly more powerful hardware today can save you from frequent upgrades later.

## Alternatives in Amazon

With the considerations above in mind, I would recommend looking for a Mini PC that has either an Intel N100 or N150 with 8GB or 16GB RAM and 2 (or more) NVMe slots for hard drive.
