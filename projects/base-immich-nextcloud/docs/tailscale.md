# Tailscale Account Setup

It is always useful to have access to tools that can let us manage our server, whether at home or remotely. However, we want to make sure that access to these tools is extra secure. For this project, we are going to use [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) to accomplish this. With Tailscale, we will be use a VPN network to ensure only other personal devices (e.g. a laptop or phone) can reach certain access points on our server.

## Tailscale VPN

Tailscale is a peer-to-peer virtual private network (VPN) solution that allows you to create a secure, private network between your devicesâ€”no matter where they are. Unlike traditional VPNs, which require complex setup and dedicated servers, Tailscale is built on top of the WireGuard protocol and works seamlessly by connecting devices directly to each other using encrypted tunnels. This peer-to-peer architecture minimizes latency and provides fast, secure access without the need for manual firewall or NAT configuration.
