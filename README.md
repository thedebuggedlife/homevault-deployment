# Self-host Bootstrap Projects

A curated collection of `docker-compose` projects designed to simplify and accelerate bootstrapping your self-hosted applications. Each project provides an **opinionated yet flexible** foundation, addressing common self-hosting concerns, including:

- ✅ **Network topology**
- 🔐 **Secret management**
- 🌐 **DNS management**
- 🔑 **Authentication, authorization, and SSO**
- 🔄 **Reverse proxy configuration**

All projects build upon the foundational core functionality provided by [`base-cftunnel-tailnet`](./projects/base-cftunnel-tailnet), which includes essential capabilities such as secure access, reverse proxy setup, authentication and authorization, Single Sign-On (SSO), and more.

Feel free to tailor each project according to your specific self-hosting requirements.
